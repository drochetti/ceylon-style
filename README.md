Motivation
----------

The main purpose of this is to study the Ceylon language type system and expressiveness.
I have tested tools like SCSS+Compass, Less+Bootstrap, Stylus and I feel that a static typed expressive stylesheet framework for Ceylon is the natural way to go, so I tried a draft of it to try the whole thing (types, alias, union, syntax sugar, etc).

Feedback appreciated!
